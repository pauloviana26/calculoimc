# calculoimc
My first android app.
This is an app for body mass index calculation.
I had to put the weight in grams and the height in centimeters because I could not set the seekbar value to Double / Float to be printed in textview. if anyone knows and can help me I really appreciate.

How to:

1- set weight and height
2- set sexual option
3- click on "calcular"
4- the result will be your BMI
5- click on "tabela"
6- the alert will show the imc table by gender
